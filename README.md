This repository contains the established models discussed in the paper: "A Physics-constrained Deep Learning Based Approach for Acoustic Inverse Scattering Problems." 

In this study, three scenarios of acoustic scattering experiments are designed:
Scenario 1: Single Frequency - Single Scatterer, where the number of scatterers is one, and the incident wave is generated with one wave frequency.
Scenario 2: Single Frequency - Cluster of Scatterers, where the number of scatterers is four, and the incident wave is generated with one wave frequency.
Scenario 3: Single Frequency - Cluster of Scatterers, where the number of scatterers is four, and the incident wave is generated with one wave frequency.
